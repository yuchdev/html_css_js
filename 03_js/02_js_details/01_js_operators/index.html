<h1>JavaScript Operators</h1>

<h2>Arithmetic Operators</h2>

<p>
    Basic arithmetic in JS is intuitive and follows the same rules as in math.<br>
    Operators precedence also follows the same rules as in math.<br>
    Available operators are: <code>+, -, *, /, %, ++, --, **</code>,
    where <code>**</code> is exponentiation, and <code>%</code> is the remainder of the division.
</p>

<h3>Arithmetic Operators & Assignment</h3>

<p>
    All arithmetic operations can be combined with assignment operators, e.g.
    <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code>, <code>/=</code>, <code>%=</code>, <code>**=</code>.
</p>

<h3>Operations with strings</h3>

<p>
    Operation <code>+</code> works as concatenation for strings, e.g. <code>"a" + "b" = "ab"</code>.
    When a string is added to a number, the result is a string concatenation, e.g.
    <code>"1" + 2 = "12"</code>
</p>

<h2>Comparison Operators</h2>

<p>
    Comparison operators are used to compare two values, and return a boolean value.
    Available operators are: <code>==</code>, <code>===</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>!==</code>,
    <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>.<br>
    Note the difference between <code>==</code> and <code>===</code> operators,
    as well as <code>!=</code> and <code>!==</code> operators.
    The latter is strict equality, including type of compared values.
</p>

<h3>Comparison with null, undefined and NaN</h3>

<p>
    <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> are equal to each other, but not to any other value.
    <code>NaN</code> is result of incorrect mathematical operations, and is not equal to anything,
    and is not equal to anything, including itself.
</p>

<h2>Logical Operators</h2>

<p>
    Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
    Available operators are: <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>!</code>.
</p>

<h3>Nullish Coalescing Operator</h3>

<p>
    The nullish coalescing operator <code>??</code> returns the first operand if it is not null or undefined,
    otherwise the second operand, e.g.
</p>

<code>
    let a = 1;<br>
    let b = 0;<br>
    let c = a ?? b; // c = 1<br>
    let d = null ?? b; // d = 0<br>
    let e = undefined ?? b; // e = 0<br>
    let f = 0 ?? b; // f = 0<br>
</code>

<h3>Optional Chaining Operator</h3>

<p>
    The optional chaining operator <code>?.</code> allows to access properties of nested objects without
    checking if the object exists, e.g.
</p>

<code>
    let user = {<br>
        name: "John",<br>
        age: 30,<br>
        address: {<br>
            street: "Main",<br>
            number: 1<br>
        }<br>
    };<br>
    let street = user.address.street; // street = "Main"<br>
    let number = user.address.number; // number = 1<br>
    let city = user.address.city; // city = undefined<br>
    let city = user?.address?.city; // city = undefined<br>
</code>

<h2>Bitwise Operators</h2>

<p>
    Bitwise operators treat their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones).
    Bitwise operators perform their operations on such binary representations,
    and return standard 64-bits JavaScript number.
</p>

<p>
    JS offers standard set of bitwise operators:
    <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>~</code>,
    <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>.<br>
    Note the difference between <code>&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> operators.<br>
    The first one is signed right shift, which pushing leftmost bit to the right,
    and the rightmost bits fall off.
    The second one is unsigned right shift, which pushing zeros from the left,
    and the rightmost bits fall off.
</p>


<p>
    Functions in JS are objects, so they can be assigned to variables.
    They can also be passed as arguments to other functions, and can be returned by other functions.
    Operator <code>())</code> used to call a function, from the code, or from an event handler.
    Also, there are self-invoking functions, which are invoked (started) automatically, without being called.
