<h1>Styling border, margin, padding and outline</h1>

<h2>CSS Box Model</h2>

<p>
    In HTML every element is considered a box.
    In the center of the box it has a content.
    Outside the content comes padding, then border, then margin, and finally the outline.
    When you set the size of the box, its actually size of the content,
    but the actual size of the box is the sum of the content size and the padding, border and margin.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Padding is used to create space around an element's content, inside any defined borders. Padding can be only positive</li>
    <li>Border is used to create a visible border around an element's content</li>
    <li>
        Margin is used to create space around an element, outside any defined borders. Margin can be negative.
        When two margins meet each other, they collapse into a single margin with the size of the largest margin.
    </li>
    <li>Outline is used to create a visible border around an element's content</li>
</ul>

<p>
    It could be overwritten by a CSS rule <code>box-sizing</code>,
    which could be set to <code>border-box</code> or <code>content-box</code>,
    with the default value of <code>content-box</code>.
    However, <code>border-box</code> could be more comfortable to work with as more explicit.
</p>

<p>
    By default, the HTML element tries to fit its size according to the content size.
    If you restrain the size of the element, oversize content will be spilled out.
    This behavior could be changed with the <code>overflow</code> property,
    which could be set to <code>auto</code>, which is default, <code>hidden</code>
    and even <code>scroll</code> to scroll over the content.
    While vertical scrolling could be useful, horizontal scrolling is considered bad practice.
    Also, having more than one scrolling element inherited from one another
    often frustrates the user.
</p>

<h2>Border, margin and outline</h2>

<div class="box">
    <p class="content">
        Here's the content of the box. It has 10px padding (space inside the border),
        5px border, and 20px margin (space outside the border).
    </p>
</div>

<div class="box-own-margin">
    <p class="content">
        Here's more content. It has the same content, but now the containing box add its own
        padding 10px, border 5px, and margin 5px.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="box-limited-width">
    <p class="content">
        It is the same as the first box, but we restrict its width to 300px.
        Height of the content is still adjusted to fit it!
        Let's see the real content width:<br>
        <code>300-(20+10+5)*2 = 230px</code>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="box-content-box">
    <p class="content">
        This is combination of the size <code>250px</code> and CSS property<br>
        <code>box-sizing: content-box</code>
    </p>
</div>

<div class="box-border-box">
    <p class="content">
        This is combination of the size <code>250px</code> and CSS property<br>
        <code>box-sizing: border-box</code>
    </p>
</div>
