<h1>Styling border, margin, padding and outline</h1>

<h2>CSS Box Model</h2>

<p>
    In HTML every element is considered a box.
    In the center of the box it has a content.
    Outside the content comes padding, then border, and finally margin.
    When you set the size of the box, its actually size of the content,
    but the actual size of the box is the sum of the content size and the padding, border and margin.
</p>

<p>
    It could be overwritten by a CSS rule <code>box-sizing</code>,
    which could be set to <code>border-box</code> or <code>content-box</code>,
    with the default value of <code>content-box</code>.
    However, <code>border-box</code> could be more comfortable to work with as more explicit.
</p>

<p>
    By default, the HTML element tries to fit its size according to the content size.
    If you restrain the size of the element, oversize content will be spilled out.
    This behavior could be changed with the <code>overflow</code> property,
    which could be set to <code>auto</code>, which is default, <code>hidden</code>
    and even <code>scroll</code> to scroll over the content.
    While vertical scrolling could be useful, horizontal scrolling is considered bad practice.
    Also, having more than one scrolling element inherited from one another
    often frustrates the user.
