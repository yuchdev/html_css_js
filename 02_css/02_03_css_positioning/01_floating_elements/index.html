<h1>CSS Positioning by Floating</h1>

<h2>Definition</h2>

<div>
    Most of web UIs are implemented by floating elements. Floating elements are positioned relative to the viewport.
    TODO: come back here
</div>

<h2>Normal document flow</h2>

<div class="background">
    <p class="p1">Paragraph One</p>
    <p class="p2">Paragraph Two</p>
    <p class="p3">Paragraph Three</p>
    <p class="p4">Paragraph Four</p>
    <div>
        All 4 sub-paragraphs are parts of the normal document flow.
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Floating one element to the right</h2>

<div class="background">
    <p class="p1-floating">Paragraph One</p>
    <p class="p2">Paragraph Two</p>
    <p class="p3">Paragraph Three</p>
    <p class="p4">Paragraph Four</p>
    <div>
        Only first paragraph is floating to the right. As we see, it is taken out of the normal document flow.
        Also, we can notice that margins of the normal document flow are collapsing,
        and the margin of the floating element is not affected.
        That's why we can see margins of the floating element to the top.
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Floating all elements to the right</h2>

<div class="background">
    <p class="p1-floating">Paragraph One</p>
    <p class="p2-floating">Paragraph Two</p>
    <p class="p3-floating">Paragraph Three</p>
    <p class="p4-floating">Paragraph Four</p>
    <div>
        Now all elements are floating to the right. However, we also see background element height collapsed,
        because all its children taken out of the normal document flow.
    </div>
</div>

<h2 id="floating-left">Floating all elements to the left</h2>

<div class="background">
    <p class="p1-floating" style="float: left">Paragraph One</p>
    <p class="p2-floating" style="float: left">Paragraph Two</p>
    <p class="p3-floating" style="float: left">Paragraph Three</p>
    <p class="p4-floating" style="float: left">Paragraph Four</p>
    <div>
        Now all elements are floating to the left (note, how we have overwritten the style in the element).
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Resuming the document flow</h2>

<div class="background-resume">
    <p class="p1-floating">Paragraph One</p>
    <p class="p2-floating">Paragraph Two</p>
    <p class="p3-floating">Paragraph Three</p>
    <p class="p4-resume">Paragraph Four</p>
    <div>
        Now we will ask to resume normal document flow to the right of the paragraph with class "p4-resume",
        and at jumps to the next line.
        You can resume the document flow from left, right, or both of sides of the element.<br>
        One more interesting side effect: here we see how margins of the previous paragraph from
        <a href="#floating-left">Floating all elements to the left</a> impact positioning of our paragraph.
        When clearing floats, you should match their positioning: whet the element floats to the left,
        you should clear floats from the left side.<br>
    </div>

</div>

<h2>Clearing both sides</h2>

<div class="background-resume">
    <p class="p1" style="float: left; height: 200px">Paragraph One</p>
    <p class="p2" style="float: right; height: 300px">Paragraph Two</p>
    <p class="p3" style="clear: both">Paragraph Three</p>
    <p class="p4">Paragraph Four</p>
    <div>
        In the situation, when we have elements floating to the left and to the right,
        like in this example, we can clear floats from both sides using <code>clear: both</code>.
        In this case, the cleared elements jumps to the line next to
        the tallest element.
    </div>

</div>

<h2>Clearfix method</h2>

<div class="clearfix">
    <p class="p1-floating">Paragraph One</p>
    <p class="p2-floating">Paragraph Two</p>
    <p class="p3-floating">Paragraph Three</p>
    <p class="p4-floating">Paragraph Four</p>
    <div>
        There's one more method to fit all floating elements in the parent element.
        We add to the parent element property <code>overflow: auto</code>.
        Control of padding and margins are still on you though.
    </div>
</div>
