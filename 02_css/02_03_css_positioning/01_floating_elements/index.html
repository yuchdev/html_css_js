<h1>CSS Positioning by Floating</h1>

<h2>Definition</h2>

<div>
    Most of web UIs are implemented by floating elements. Floating elements are positioned relative to the viewport.
    TODO: come back here
</div>

<h2>Normal document flow</h2>

<div class="background">
    <p class="p1">Paragraph One</p>
    <p class="p2">Paragraph Two</p>
    <p class="p3">Paragraph Three</p>
    <p class="p4">Paragraph Four</p>
    This is background div. <br>
    All 4 sub-paragraphs are parts of the normal document flow.
</div>

<h2>Floating one element to the right</h2>

<div class="background">
    <p class="p1-floating">Paragraph One</p>
    <p class="p2">Paragraph Two</p>
    <p class="p3">Paragraph Three</p>
    <p class="p4">Paragraph Four</p>
    <div>
        Only first paragraph is floating to the right. As we see, it is taken out of the normal document flow.
        Also, we can notice that margins of the normal document flow are collapsing,
        and the margin of the floating element is not affected.
        That's why we can see margins of the floating element to the top.
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Floating all elements to the right</h2>

<div class="background">
    <p class="p1-floating">Paragraph One</p>
    <p class="p2-floating">Paragraph Two</p>
    <p class="p3-floating">Paragraph Three</p>
    <p class="p4-floating">Paragraph Four</p>
    <div>
        Now all elements are floating to the right. However, we also see background element height collapsed,
        because all its children taken out of the normal document flow.
    </div>
</div>

<h2>Resuming the document flow</h2>

<div class="background-resume">
    <p class="p1-floating">Paragraph One</p>
    <p class="p2-floating">Paragraph Two</p>
    <p class="p3-floating">Paragraph Three</p>
    <p class="p4-resume">Paragraph Four</p>
    <div>
        Now we will ask to resume normal document flow to the right of the paragraph with class "p4-resume",
        and at jumps to the next line.
        You can resume the document flow from left, right, or both of sides of the element.
