<h1>CSS Positioning Properties</h1>


<h2>Types of CSS position property</h2>

<p>
    The position property is used to set the positioning method of an element.
    It is easily to understand by looking at the examples below, rather than explanation.
    CSS offers the following types of positioning:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>static</code> - default value, or normal document flow</li>
    <li><code>relative</code> - element is positioned relative to its normal position</li>
    <li><code>fixed</code> - element is positioned relative to the document itself</li>
    <li><code>absolute</code> - element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor</li>
    <li><code>sticky</code> - element is positioned based on user's scroll position</li>
</ul>

<h2>Static and relative</h2>

<p class="static-example">
    This is static positioning, or normal document flow. It is not affected by
    <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>top</code>, or <code>bottom</code> CSS properties.
</p>

<p class="relative-example">
    This is relative positioning, or positioned relative to its normal (static) position.
    Other HTML content is not adjusted in any way.
</p>

<h2>Absolute and fixed</h2>

<div class="relative-parent">
    This is a parent element for the absolutely positioned element.
    We'll make it big in order to properly demonstrate the next example.

    <p class="absolute-example">
        This is absolute positioning related to the parent element.
        Absolutely positioned element is removed from the normal flow of the document.
    </p>

</div>

<p class="fixed-example">
    This is fixed positioning, or positioned relative to the document (viewport) itself.
    The element is not affected by the scroll position of the document, and always remains in the same position.
    Fixed positioned element is removed from the normal flow of the document,
    and is able to overlap other elements.
</p>

<h2>Sticky</h2>

<div class="sticky-example">
    This is sticky positioning, or positioned based on user's scroll position.
    The element is not affected by the scroll position of the document, and always remains in the same position.
    Sticky positioned element is removed from the normal flow of the document.<br>
    Note: Safari requires the <code>-webkit-sticky</code> property for the element to be sticky.
    Obviously, in order to make the element sticky, at least one of the following properties must be set:
    <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>, or <code>right</code>
    (we must set where elements should be stuck to).

</div>

<h2>Example: position text over the image</h2>

<div class="image-container">
    <img src="img/manule.jpg" alt="Text Positioning" width="427" height="427">
    <p class="text-over-image">
        This is text positioned over the image
    </p>
</div>

</body>
