        But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
        born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the
        great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
        pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
        rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves
        or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
        occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
