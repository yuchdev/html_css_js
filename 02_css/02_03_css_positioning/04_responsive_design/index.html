<h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>

<h2>How RWD works</h2>

<p>
    In the early days of the internet, websites were mostly viewed on desktop computers,
    thus, only one version of a website was needed, with static size and design.<br>
    However, with the rise of mobile devices, the need for a single version of a website
    that works well on all devices became apparent.
</p>

<h2>Viewport</h2>

<p>
    The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.
    It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.<br>
    In order to let the browser know we utilize Responsive Design,
    we need to add the following meta-tag to the head section of our HTML document:<br>
    <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;</code>
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>width=device-width</code> sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device</li>
    <li><code>initial-scale=1.0</code> sets the initial zoom level when the page is loaded</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fitting the content to the screen</h3>

<p>
    There are simple rules to follow in order to make your website responsive:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The users got used to vertical, but not horizontal scrolling. Horizontal scrolling considered a bad user experience</li>
    <li>Use relative units of measurement, such as percentages, ems, rems, etc.</li>
    <li>Do not design particularly large (wide) elements, as they will not fit on smaller screens</li>
    <li>Always start your design with the smallest screen size for mobile devices</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grid View</h2>

<p>
    Grid view is a layout that consists of a number of columns and rows, which are used to fit the content,
    that may take one or more columns and/or rows.
</p>

<h3>Grid View multi-column layout example</h3>

<p>
    Here we try to provide different number of columns for different screen sizes.
    In our particular example, we use 8 columns maximum, so we calculate the width of each column as follows:
    <code>100% / 8 = 12.5%</code><br>
    On practice, modern CSS frameworks, like Twitter Bootstrap, support up to 12 columns.
</p>

<p>
    Using Media Queries, we can provide different number of columns for different screen sizes, e.g. for<br>
    <code>@media screen and (min-width: 950px) and (max-width: 1199px)</code><br>
    we provide 4 columns, so the width of each column is 25%.
</p>

<p class="row">

    <div class="column-large-01 column-medium-01 column-small-01 column-extra-small-01">
        <p class="column">This is column 1</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-large-01 column-medium-01 column-small-01 column-extra-small-01">
        <p class="column">This is column 2</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-large-01 column-medium-01 column-small-01 column-extra-small-01">
        <p class="column">This is column 3</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-large-01 column-medium-01 column-small-01 column-extra-small-01">
        <p class="column">This is column 4</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-large-01 column-medium-01 column-small-01 column-extra-small-01">
        <p class="column">This is column 5</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-large-01 column-medium-01 column-small-01 column-extra-small-01">
        <p class="column">This is column 6</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-large-01 column-medium-01 column-small-01 column-extra-small-01">
        <p class="column">This is column 7</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-large-01 column-medium-01 column-small-01 column-extra-small-01">
        <p class="column">This is column 8</p>
    </div>
</p>

<p>
    Note: Every browser has Developer Tools, which allow to see the layout of the page on the most common screen sizes,
    popular devices and different screen orientations.
</p>


<h2>CSS Flexbox</h2>

<p>
    CSS Flexbox is the more modern way to create a responsive layout.
