<h1>CSS Conflict Resolution</h1>

<h2>Why CSS is <i>Cascading</i> Stylesheet</h2>

<p>
    CSS is called <dfn>cascading</dfn>, because this is exactly how its rules are applied.
    The simple rule of CSS conflict resolution could be said like:
    "The last declaration wins".
    Also, it could be said, that HTML is processed from top to bottom,
    and CSS is processed from bottom to top.
</p>

<p class="merged" style="font-family: Arial, monospace">
    When CSS rules do not conflict, they are being merged. E.g. this paragraph is styled from
    the external CSS file to have light-gray background and blueviolet text color.
    At the same time, it is directly styled to have Arial Mono font.
    These rules are being merged, because they are not conflicting.
</p>

<p>
    External CSS is applied after the place where is inserted the HTML code.
    Usually it is placed in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section.
</p>

<h2>Inheritance in HTML document</h2>

<!-- TODO: sort out the inheritance -->
<div>
    Technically HTML document is a tree of elements.
    Each element has its own style, however, its child elements inherit the style of their parent.

    <p style="background: orange">
        This <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element is inherited from the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element,
        and it inherits the font, but has its own background color.
    </p>

</div>

<h2>Specificity of CSS rules</h2>

<p>
    CSS rules have a specificity, which is a number of the rules that are applied to the element.
    The more specifically rules are applied, the higher is the specificity.
    The most specific rule is applied first.
</p>

<p>
    Different ways of applying the rule have different degree of specificity.
    Let's explain this. Imagine that higher element in the following list offers higher specificity:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>CSS rule with the <code>!important</code> keyword overrides any rules.</li>
    <li><code>style</code> attribute of the element</li>
    <li>Styling according to <code>id</code> attribute of the element</li>
    <li>Styling according to class, pseudo-class, or pseudo-element</li>
    <li>Styling according to the element relationship (child, descendant, sibling, etc)</li>
    <li>Styling according to the direct element type</li>
</ul>
