<h1>This is header 1st level</h1>

<h2>This is header 2nd level</h2>

<p>
    As you see, color of 1st-level header is crimson, font size is 32 pixel and is has been put to center.
    These CSS properties would be applied to all 1st level headers of this document.
    All paragraphs in the HTML document are colored gray, have font Courier New of size 14 pixel,
    and the width of every paragraph is 600 pixel.
</p>

<p>
    Meanwhile, 2nd-level heading has not been affected, but it seems to have some specific style already.
    This style called default and comes from the browser itself. That's why, it may slightly vary
    from one browser to another.
</p>

<h2>This is another header 2nd level</h2>

<p>
    Fun fact: when you need to fill the document with some dummy text, just to see how it looks like,
    in such cases traditionally used a placeholder text called "Lorem Ipsum". It is a citation of
    the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, from his book
    <cite>De finibus bonorum et malorum</cite> (<cite>On the ends of good and evil</cite>),
    and it was in use way before web technologies, mostly in publishing and graphic design.
