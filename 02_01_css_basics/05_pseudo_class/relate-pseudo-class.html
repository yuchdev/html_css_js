<h1>Styling elements with different relationships through pseudo-classes</h1>

<p>
    We make elements more visual by adding different background colors to them as an inline CSS style.

<h2>List of related selectors</h2>

<h3><code>:root</code> selector</h3>

<a href="root-pseudo-class.html">The <code>:root</code> selector</a> matches the while document's root element.

<h3><code>:empty</code> selector</h3>

The <code>:empty</code> selector matches every element that has no children (including text content).

<p></p>

<p>Paragraph with text content</p>

<h3>N-th child pseudo-classes</h3>
<ul>
    <li><code>:first-child</code> - Select every element that is the first child of its parent</li>
    <li><code>:last-child</code> - Select every element that is the last child of its parent</li>
    <li><code>:nth-child(n)</code> - Select every element that is the n-th child of its parent</li>
    <li>
        <code>:nth-last-child(n)</code> - Select every element
        that is the n-th from the end child of its parent
    </li>
</ul>

The <code>:nth-child(n)</code> selector used to style element that is the N-th child,
regardless of type, of its parent. N can be a number, a keyword (live <code>odd</code>),
or a formula (like <code>3n</code>). Could be handy to style every 2nd table or list row
for better visualization.

<h3><code>:only-child</code> and <code>:only-of-type</code> selector</h3>

<h3>N-th of type pseudo-classes</h3>

<ul>
    <li><code>:first-of-type</code> - Select every element that is the first of this type of its parent</li>
    <li><code>:last-of-type</code> - Select every element that is the last of this type of its parent</li>
    <li><code>:nth-of-type(n)</code> - Select every element that is the n-th element of this type of its parent</li>
    <li>
        <code>:nth-last-of-type(n)</code> - Select every element
        that is the n-th element from the end of this type of its parent
    </li>
</ul>

The <code>:nth-of-type(n)</code> selector matches every element that is the nth child, of a particular type.
N also can be a keyword or formula.
