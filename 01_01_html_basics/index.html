<!doctype HTML>
<!--
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration tag.
This tag is mostly historical, it states that the HTML document fits Standard.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case-sensitive.
-->

<!-- Skipping it page would be rendered in Quirk Mode.
In quirks mode, layout emulates nonstandard behavior in Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5.
This is essential in order to support websites that were built before the widespread adoption of web standards.
In full standard's mode, the behavior is (hopefully) the behavior described by the HTML and CSS specifications.
In almost standard's mode, there are only a very small number of quirks implemented.-->

<h1>Basics of the Web</h1>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>
    HTML, CSS and JS could be considered as three main pillars of the Web.
    HTML is responsible for structure, CSS for style and layout, and JavaScript for behavior of the web page.
</p>

<h2>Web Developer Tools and Resources</h2>

    as well as hyperlink tag <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.
    See details about HTML lists and links in respective chapters.
</p>

<h2>Standardization and Intro into W3C</h2>

<p>
    Most W3C work revolves around the standardization of Web technologies.
    If the feature is defined in standard, it does not mean it's implemented in actual browsers.
    Standardization includes multiple documents, defining subsets of the WWW.
    Standard texts have very "academic" style, and unlikely fit for studying Web technologies.
    W3C Standards cover such important domains, like:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>HTML&CSS - fundamental technologies for building Web</li>
    <li>
        JavaScript - ECMAScript Standard (more widely known as JavaScript) is developed by
        <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/">ECMA</a>,
        however, many of the client-side JavaScript APIs are being developed by W3C
    </li>
    <li>Graphics - the most well-known graphical formats for Web are PNG and SVG</li>
    <li>Many more: Audio&Video, Mobile Web, Localization, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h1>HTML Elements</h1>

<p>
    HTML elements defined by constructs called tags.
    Most tags look like <code>&lt;tag&gt;&lt;/tag&gt;</code>,
    where <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code> is called start tag, and <code>&lt;/tag&gt;</code> is called end tag.
    HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.
</p>

<p>Tag can't contain front spaces: <code>&lt;&nbsp;tag&gt;</code> - this is wrong!</p>

<p>Tag trailing spaces are ignored: <code>&lt;tag&nbsp;&gt;</code></p >

<p>
    Some elements can't have content, and their tags can be "start only",
    e.g. line break tag <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, horizontal line tag <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>.
    Such elements are called empty elements.
</p>

<p>
    If HTML element can have content, but does not, its start and end tag can be the one,
    and look like <code>&lt;tag&nbsp;&gt;</code>. Such tags called self-closing.
</p>

<p>
    In HTML5 it is illegal to make self-closing tags if one can open and close them explicitly.
</p>

<!-- Headings from 1 to 6
    Headings tell ONLY about the document structure, not about the style
-->
<h1>This is the demonstration of headings</h1>
<h2>Subheading 2</h2>
<h3>Subheading 3</h3>
<h4>Subheading 4</h4>
<h5>Subheading 5</h5>
<h6>Subheading 6</h6>

<h2>Document structuring</h2>

<p lang="en-us">Headings have levels from 1 to 6 </p>

<p>
    Headings tell ONLY about the document structure, not about the style.
    This is so-called <b>Structural markup</b>
</p>

<p>
    Browsers automatically add some space (margin) before and after each paragraph element.
    <br>The margins can be modified with CSS (with the margin properties)
    <br><code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag is a single line break
</p>

<!-- Horizontal line defines a thematic break -->
<hr>

<p>
    The <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page (e.g. a shift of topic).
    Also, it is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.
</p>

<p>
    Since HTML4, tags could be block-level or inline.
</p>

<p>
    A block-level element always starts on a new line.
    A block-level element always takes up the full width available
    (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
    A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.
    Ex. The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is a block-level element.
</p>

<p>
    An inline element does not start on a new line.
    An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
    Ex. The <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element is an inline element.
</p>

<h2>Root document <code>index.html</code></h2>

<p>
    The main homepage of a site written in HTML (and the homepages of each section in a child folder)
    is called <code>index.html</code>.
    Web servers are usually set up to return the index.html file if no file name is specified.
</p>

<h2>HTML categories</h2>

<p>
    HTML5 introduces 9 <a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/#categories">HTML categories</a>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Metadata content includes elements for marking up document metadata;
        marking up or linking to resources that describe the behaviour or presentation of the document;
        or indicate relationships with other documents
    </li>

    <li>
        Flow content. Most of the elements used to mark up the main content in the body of a page
        are considered to be flow content.
        In general, this includes elements that are presented visually as either block level or inline level.
    </li>

    <li>
        Sectioning root elements can have their own outlines, but the sections and headers
        inside these elements do not contribute to the outlines of their ancestors.
    </li>

    <li>
        Sectioning content is used for structuring a document into sections,
        each of which generally has its own heading.
        These elements provide a scope within which associated headers, footers and contact information apply.

        <br/>HTML Navigational Element <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> defines a section that contains navigation links
        that appear often on a site.

        <br/>HTML Article Element <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> defines a piece of self-contained content.

        <br/>HTML Section Element <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> defines a section of a document
        to indicate a related grouping of semantic meaning.

        <br/>HTML Aside Element <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> defines a section that,
        though related to the main element, doesn't belong to the main flow,
        like an explanation box or an advertisement.
    </li>

    <li>
        Heading content includes the elements for marking up headers.
        Headings, in conjunction with the sectioning elements,
        are used to describe the structure of the document.
    </li>

    <li>
        Phrasing content includes text and text-level markup.
        This is similar to the concept of inline level elements in HTML 4.01.
        Most elements that are categorised as phrasing content can only contain other phrasing content.
    </li>

    <li>
        Embedded content includes elements that load external resources into the document.
        Such external resources include, for example, images, videos and Flash-based content.
    </li>

    <li>
        Interactive elements are those that allow the user to interact with or activate in some way.
        Depending on the userâ€™s browser and device, this could be performed using any kind of input device,
        such as, for example, a mouse, keyboard, touch screen or voice input.
    </li>

    <li>
        Transparent Content Models.
        Some elements have transparent content models, meaning that their allowed content
        depends upon the parent element.
        They may contain any content that their parent element may contain,
        in addition to any other allowances or exceptions described for the element.
    </li>

</ul>

<h2>Structural and semantic markup</h2>

<p>
    Structural markup embeds information about the structure of a document.
    Structure includes elements like headings, paragraphs, breaks, lists, tables.
    Like this paragraph, for example.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Semantic markup</strong> is the use of an HTML language to emphasize information
    about the meaning of each element in a document through proper choice of markup elements.
